## About

Keydrop is a project that aims to create a keyboard that adapts to the user. The idea is to hide the keys which are unlikely to be pressed and display a different key (that is more likely to be pressed) in their place.

This project is a prototype of a keyboard developed for research purposes. 
It has minimal error checking, and some bugs are possible. 
There is no warranty, and you use it at your own risk.

## Requirements

To run the application, only a web browser is needed, 
but installing the application on the phone is recommended.

For code execution following requirements needs to be met:

* Python (for processing data)
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Quasar Framework (Vue.js)

## Testing

The testing application is still available at [rsusik.github.io/test](https://rsusik.github.io/test) (works only on cell phone as PWA), but we no longer collect any data.



## Appendix

We conducted an experiment involving 54 participants, to find out if the Keydrop keyboard layout is competitive to the gboard-like QWERTY layout in terms of typing speed and the number of typos. The task was to manually copy English sentences; typos were highlighted and had to be fixed immediately.
Results showed that, on average, users type by 6% faster, making 33% fewer typos.
