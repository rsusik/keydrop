## About

Keydrop is a project that aims to create a keyboard that adapts to the user. The idea is to hide the keys which are unlikely to be pressed and display a different key (that is more likely to be pressed) in their place.

This project is a prototype of a keyboard developed for research purposes. 
It has minimal error checking, and some bugs are possible. 
There is no warranty, and you use it at your own risk.

## Requirements

To run the application, only a web browser is needed, 
but installing the application on the phone is recommended.

For code execution following requirements needs to be met:

* Python (for processing data)
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Quasar Framework (Vue.js)
